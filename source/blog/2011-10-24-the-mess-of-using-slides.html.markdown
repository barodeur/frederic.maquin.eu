###In academic training, we have little to no information on how to make slides.###

And more, no teaching is done about the tips of a good presentation (and if you pretend you had such class, be sure to check whether the teacher actually had a real experience about the topic). This results in an incredible number of deaths by powerpoint, when the speaker uses the slides as a notepad. Fellow students, lets confess this: we never rehearse our presentation. And some of us always finish the slides the second before the actual presentation. We are notorious for that. This will remain forever. But we can improve, along the way, on how to design slides and how to behave *on stage*.
 
Bullet points slides annoy me. They are most of the time as dull as hell. I don't mean they can't be used in some cases, but used unnecessarily, they lead to boredom.
 
I've always felt slides were made to go along with the soft melody coming out from the speaker's mouth. They were supposed to enhance the speaker's though, not replace them. This is why images are powerful. Sight usually works faster than hearing and make a concept easier to understand. I love images; I hate text. In some cases, though, such as mathematical presentations, it's impossible to avoid formulae. Are formulae text? That remains an open question.
 
Those thoughts led me to look for alternate resources explaining the art of making slides, or tools actually easing it.

####LaTeX####

I have a scientific background. Even if most of the time I dislike it, I'm used to talk about mathematical stuff. In such cases, I enjoy using Beamer over LaTeX. It quickly offers clean and readable slides effortlessly. You don't need taste. LaTeX has the taste for you, it puts everything in place in order to improve readability. In short, LaTeX has been my first choice for many years. Slides were very simple, sober and not very gripping, but not ugly either. Nothing to embarrass yourself.

####Prezi & Sozi####

A few years ago, I felt bored by my LaTeX slides. I was looking for something a little more dynamic, gripping, expressive and conclusive. Then, I discovered [Prezi](http://prezi.com/ "Prezi") and later [Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr/wiki/sozi "Sozi") its open source clone. First, I felt excited. In one sentence, let's say that Prezi/Sozi, makes your presentation look like a zoom-and-move-around trip through a giant canvas with clusters of ideas paint on it. It's very dynamic and helpful for imaginative people. Unfortunately, using these tools properly is very hard. It is easy to let the content of your presentation sleep through your fingers. By trying to astonish your audience with useless effects, you lose the content, you lose your point, you lose yourself. These tools require you to have taste and rigor. I can't use Prezi, as I dive and drown into the dark sea of uselessness.
 
Finally, I took my old latex slides back from the attic.

####Steal This Presentation! - Slideshare Era####

A few months ago, I came across this [amazing presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/jessedee/steal-this-presentation-5038209 "Steal this presentation!") on Slideshare. It blew my mind out. These slides were dynamic, gripping and expressive. Exactly what I was looking for. I encourage everyone to check every slides made par [JESSEDEE](http://www.slideshare.net/jessedee "Jesseedee").
 
Unfortunately, my first try with alternate slide design ended up badly, because I did not care. I did not rehearse. I did not produced any true content. They were only a nicely-packed empty box. I focused on the way my slides would look rather than working on what I would say and what they would mean. In a way, I stuck myself in the same trap Prezi would ambush me with. That's now a matter of trial and error!
 
#####Edit:######

Thanks to [Laurent Kretz](http://www.laurentk.com/ "Laurent Kretz") and his lecture during the Startup Weekend Strasbourg, I discovered [Emiland De Cubber](http://www.slideshare.net/EmilandDC "Emiland De Cubber") who design beautiful slides, sometimes filled with interesting advice. Be sure to check him out on Slideshare!
 
By the way, Slideshare is a nice place, there are plenty of well made slides to draw inspiration from.
